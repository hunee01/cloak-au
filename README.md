## Branch naming
1. Number showing the iteration from the `main` branch
2. Letter showing the iteration from the non-`main` branch (if lowercase letters are unavailable, transition into uppercase)
3. Hyphen followed by the author

*e.g.*\
### `1b-JohnDoe`
The **1**st branch from the main, **b** (2nd) branch from the non-main (directly after `1a`) and written by **JohnDoe**.

### `50S-Frodo`
(A rather extreme case)\
The **50**th branch from the main, **S** (45th) branch from the non-main (directly after `50R`, which is 18 after the 26th, ending at `50z`) and written by **Frodo**.
